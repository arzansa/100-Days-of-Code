These are my solutions to the challenges from the course.<br/>
Sometimes boilerplate as well as ascii art is provided, but for the most part these are my original solutions.<br/>
I take my own approach to some problems instead of copying the instructor's solutions.<br/>
I like that the course is structured with these challenges, as I find it conducive learning.<br/>
