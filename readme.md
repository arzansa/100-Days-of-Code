These are my solutions to the challenges from the course. 
Sometimes boilerplate as well as ascii art is provided, but for the most part these are my original solutions.
I take my own approach to some problems instead of copying the instructor's solutions.
I like that the course is structured with these challenges, as I find it conducive learning.
